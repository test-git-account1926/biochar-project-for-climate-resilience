## Overview

This research investigates the application of biochar—carbon-rich material produced through pyrolysis of agricultural waste—to enhance drought resilience in maize (corn) crops. Drought stress is a major constraint on maize yield worldwide, especially under climate change scenarios. Biochar has been shown to improve soil water retention, nutrient availability, and microbial activity, but its effects vary with soil type, crop variety, and environmental conditions. The objective is to evaluate biochar’s potential to reduce yield losses during water-limited conditions while promoting sustainable soil health.

## Key Research Questions

1. How does biochar amendment influence soil moisture retention and root development in maize under drought stress?
2. What is the optimal biochar application rate and particle size for maximizing yield and water use efficiency?
3. How do biochar treatments affect soil microbial communities, nutrient cycling, and long-term soil carbon sequestration?

## Methodology

The research will proceed in three stages:

1. **Controlled Greenhouse Experiments:** Test biochar from different feedstocks and particle sizes to identify combinations that improve water retention and plant growth under simulated drought.
2. **Field Trials:** Implement side-by-side plots with varying biochar application rates, measuring yield, soil moisture profiles, nutrient availability, and plant physiological indicators (e.g., stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content).
3. **Soil Health & Climate Impact Assessment:** Evaluate changes in soil microbial diversity, organic matter content, and greenhouse gas fluxes to assess long-term environmental benefits.

Data will be synthesized to provide recommendations for integrating biochar into climate-resilient maize production systems at scale.
