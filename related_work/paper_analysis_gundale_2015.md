## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
- **What problem is being solved?** Limited information exists on how different biochar feedstocks and production methods influence water retention benefits in agricultural soils. Most studies focus on single biochar types without systematic comparison.
- **Why does it matter?** Water retention is critical for crop survival during drought periods, and optimizing biochar properties for maximum water storage benefits is essential for practical agricultural applications.

### Assumption in Prior Work
- **What assumption did prior research make?** Previous studies assumed that biochar effects on water retention were primarily due to biochar porosity, with less consideration of how feedstock type and pyrolysis method systematically influence these properties.
- **Why was it inadequate?** This approach provided limited guidance for selecting optimal biochar types for specific soil types and water retention goals.

### Insight
- **What novel idea breaks from that assumption?** Different combinations of feedstock (corn stover vs. switchgrass) and pyrolysis method (fast vs. slow) create distinct water retention benefits, with fast pyrolysis biochars showing superior performance for plant available water.

### Technical Overview
- **How was the insight implemented?**
  - Systematic comparison of two feedstocks (corn stover, switchgrass) and two pyrolysis methods (fast, slow)
  - Two contrasting soil types: sandy loam (Maddock) and clay loam (Langhei)
  - Biochar incorporated at 40 g kg⁻¹ soil
  - Van Genuchten equation fitting to water retention curves
  - Focus on plant available water capacity measurements

### Proof/Evaluation
- **How was the insight validated?**
  - Significant improvements in water retention curves, particularly in macropore and mesopore regions
  - Fast pyrolysis corn stover and switchgrass biochars increased plant available water holding capacity
  - Calculated 1.4-2.6 days additional water availability for crop use at 5 mm d⁻¹ transpiration rate
  - Statistical validation using van Genuchten model fitting

### Impact
- **What are the implications?**
  - Provides specific guidance for biochar selection based on feedstock and pyrolysis method
  - Demonstrates practical benefits in terms of extended growing periods between precipitation events
  - **How will it change the field?** Likely to encourage more systematic feedstock-pyrolysis method comparisons and standardization of water retention testing protocols

## Key Findings
- Fast pyrolysis biochars (both corn stover and switchgrass) outperformed slow pyrolysis for plant available water
- Benefits were more pronounced in sandy soils compared to clay-rich soils
- Potential for 1-3 days extended crop water availability under drought conditions
- Biochar effects were most significant in the macropore and mesopore water retention regions

## Relevance to Research
This study directly informs our feedstock selection and pyrolysis optimization strategy. The focus on agricultural waste feedstocks (corn stover) and quantification of practical water availability benefits provides strong precedent for our approach.
