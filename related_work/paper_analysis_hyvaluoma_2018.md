## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
- **What problem is being solved?** There's uncertainty about how pyrolysis temperature affects the pore-size range most relevant for plant-available water storage. Gas adsorption measurements commonly used to characterize biochar cannot quantify the micrometer-range porosity crucial for water retention.
- **Why does it matter?** Understanding the relationship between production parameters and water retention properties is crucial for optimizing biochar for agricultural applications, particularly drought mitigation.

### Assumption in Prior Work
- **What assumption did prior research make?** Previous studies assumed that increased pyrogenetic porosity at higher temperatures would necessarily improve plant-available water storage capacity. Most characterization focused on nanoscale porosity rather than hydrologically relevant pore sizes.
- **Why was it inadequate?** Gas adsorption methods don't measure the micrometer-range pores that actually store plant-available water. The assumption about temperature effects wasn't validated for the relevant pore size range.

### Insight
- **What novel idea breaks from that assumption?** The initial pore structure of the raw material (feedstock properties) determines micrometer-range porosity more than pyrolysis temperature. For plant-available water storage, feedstock selection is more important than temperature optimization in the studied range.

### Technical Overview
- **How was the insight implemented?**
  - X-ray tomography used to quantify micrometer-range porosity (relevant for water storage)
  - Willow samples pyrolyzed at different temperatures (308, 384, 489°C)
  - Helium ion microscopy for nanoscale porosity examination
  - Careful sample preparation and tracing through experiments
  - Image analysis of x-ray tomography to quantify pore space

### Proof/Evaluation
- **How was the insight validated?**
  - Direct visualization and quantification of micrometer-range pore structure using advanced imaging
  - Comparative analysis across temperature range showing minimal effects on relevant pore sizes
  - Demonstrated that feedstock properties determine water-relevant porosity more than process temperature
  - Advanced microscopy confirmed findings across multiple scales

### Impact
- **What are the implications?**
  - Feedstock selection should be prioritized over temperature optimization for water retention applications
  - Challenges the focus on high-temperature pyrolysis for agricultural biochar applications
  - **How will it change the field?** Likely to shift research emphasis toward feedstock characterization and selection rather than just process optimization

## Key Findings
- Pyrolysis temperature (in studied range) has minimal effect on micrometer-range porosity crucial for plant water availability
- Initial feedstock pore structure is the primary determinant of water-relevant porosity
- Process temperature optimization may be less important than feedstock selection for water retention applications

## Relevance to Research
This study informs our pyrolysis optimization strategy, suggesting that feedstock selection (agricultural waste properties) may be more critical than temperature for water retention benefits. It supports focusing on diverse feedstock evaluation rather than extensive temperature optimization.
